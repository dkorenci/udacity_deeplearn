This code is derived from the Python notebooks for the Udacity Deep Learning course (2017 version):
https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/courses/udacity_deep_learning

The code consists of the notebook code converted to Python packages and modules
for the reason of improved code organization and handling.

Top level folders correspond to course sections, the packages correspond to assignments and resources, 
while modules correspond to subproblems, dataset handling code (dataset.py modules) and util code.

The repo contains solutions for most of the course problems, 
including word2vec-cbow, LSTM and text inverter (LSTM that learns to invert char sequences).
Some of the tensorflow models are encapsulated as separate classes 
(nn_optimal.py and text_inverter.model.py).
